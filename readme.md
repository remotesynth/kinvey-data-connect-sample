# Example for Kinvey Mobile Data Connect

This is a simple example app for using Kinvey's Mobile Data Connect to connect to swap between a NoSQL data source. You can populate the NoSQL data source using the JSON data and the SQL data source using the .sql file.

The app itself is pretty simple. It just pulls a list of employees from a database. The larger goal is to demonstrate swapping the NoSQL data store with an enterprise data source like SQL Server. You can read more about how to do this in the [accompanying article here](https://www.kinvey.com/using-kinveys-rapiddata-connectors/).
